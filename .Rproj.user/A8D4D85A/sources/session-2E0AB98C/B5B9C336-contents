Birds have an impressive journey they seasonally recur. Out of instinct, certain species know where to migrate and how to navigate back home. They use resources like the stars, sun, and earth's magnetism to help them find their way. They also almost always return home to where they were born. Their main purpose of migration is to go from areas of decreasing resources to areas with abundant resources. Birds seek two main resources: food and nesting locations, both equally fundamental to their survival. Over forty percent of the world’s birds migrate, although this is expected to increase due to the deforestation prevalence in tropical regions. In order to prepare for this grueling journey, Birds enter a state called hyperphagia, where they bulk up on food in the preceding weeks to store fat. Their aerodynamics include tailwinds, which blow in the same direction they fly in to help them go faster. Variables like speed, distance, and altitude need to be studied for these species to gain insight on their journeys. Birds play many different roles in the preservation of the environment: predators, prey, pollinators/ seed dispersers. It is imperative that through this research, humans are aided in their efforts to presrve birds’ habitats. "),

They spend the winter in savannahs from Kenya and Uganda, however,  some have even been known to make it down to the Cape Province of South Africa. Storks congregate in massive flocks despite their territorial nature. As for dietary preferences, they prefer to forage in meadows where the grasses are short  or in wetlands close to their nests. They eat a variety of foods including insects, worms, reptiles, and amphibians. They also munch on larger animals such as moles, shrews, and fish. European robins (Erithacus rubecula) head south to escape Scandinavian and northern continental Europe’s winter. Similar to the white storks, many migrating robins are faithful to both their summer and winter territories, which may be many thousands of miles apart. Robins reproduce bountifully, often producing between three and five broods a year, each set containing four or five eggs. These broods can overlap, where while the father starts nursing the recently hatched chicks, the mother is already working on the next batch. This enables the population to bounce back readily from any overwinter population losses. Animals that reproduce at such a rate signal overcompensation due to high rates of predation. A robin's lifespan is just 13 months on average due to high mortality within their first year of life. But if they can pass that marker, it increases up to 19 years. As for dietary preferences, Robins eat a wide variety of food including worms, seeds, nuts, suet, invertebrates, and fruit. Lastly, they are notorious for their familiarity with humans and forage for food in household backyards and readily accept seeds left out for them. "),

As expected the relationship between speed and altitude are inversely proportional. As for the spatial visualizations, they were able to display the distance traveled in correspondence to time.

Additionally, seven million die from striking TV and radio towers in North America annually. Not to mention the air pollution that toxifies their paths. We hope this article spreads awareness on these awe-striking creatures, so humans will have more consciousness on their carbon footprint and put an end to so much deforestation. With the dead trees gone the storks have to resort to man made structures, including houses. The draining and filling of wetlands for agricultural, housing and industrial use has greatly affected the population of storks, their feeding grounds have simply disappeared.
